Progression in chronic ILD can present itself many different ways. Some people may notice worsening symptoms, see changes in tests, like high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans or lung function tests, or have to go on supplemental oxygen, while others may not notice any signs of progression for a long time. No matter how chronic ILD with worsening fibrosis affects you, it’s important to understand what’s happening inside your body so you can take action and make informed decisions about your care."]}},

    "text": ["As scarring progresses, you may begin to feel effects on your body, including persistent symptoms like: shortness of breath; a dry, hacking cough; rapid, shallow breathing; fatigue; gradual weight loss; aching muscles and joints; widening and rounding of the fingertips or toes. Symptoms may worsen to the point that they take a toll on your well-being—from your emotional state to your ability to complete everyday tasks. Pulmonologists will track the effect of chronic ILD with worsening fibrosis on the body with certain tests , like HRCT scans, lung function tests such as forced vital capacity (FVC), and walking tests. While these tests can help provide a clearer picture of how chronic ILD may be worsening, remember that one single test may not tell the whole story. Even if one test result remains the same, chronic ILD with fibrosis may still be worsening. Additionally, it’s important to understand that test results aren’t just numbers on a chart—they may help explain why you’re feeling a certain way. That’s why it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider when your symptoms change."]}}],

Your healthcare provider may also refer to this as an “AE.” An acute exacerbation is a sudden and unpredictable worsening that can result in hospitalization and can even be fatal. The symptoms of an acute exacerbation are similar for people with chronic ILD with worsening fibrosis as with people who have IPF, but having an acute exacerbation is more common in people with IPF. It’s also important to remember that not all types of ILD have acute exacerbations.", "If you experience the symptoms above, be sure to call your healthcare provider right away. An acute exacerbation can occur at any time during the course of the disease—from diagnosis to more advanced chronic ILD with worsening fibrosis. People who have an acute exacerbation may have a higher risk of another acute exacerbation. A person’s condition after an acute exacerbation can vary, but it often results in new lung damage that worsens lung function."],
    "naturalProgression": ["If you’ve been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease (ILD) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a common type of ILD, one of the most important things for you to understand about your disease is its potential to cause progressive lung scarring, which means scarring that continues to get worse over time. By understanding ILD progression, you’ll be armed with the information you need to make important decisions about disease management, lifestyle changes, supportive needs, and palliative care. The more you know, the more empowered you’ll feel to take charge of your care. This guide can help. It will educate you about what ILD progression is, what it means for the body, and why slowing progression is so critical. Continue scrolling to learn more about ILD progression.", "In the lung of a person who has chronic ILD with worsening fibrosis, the healing process does not end.", "Scarring Progresses: As time goes on, the abnormal healing process creates more and more thick scar tissue in the alveoli walls and the spaces around the alveoli.", "When chronic ILD with worsening fibrosis first begins, you may not experience any symptoms, like shortness of breath and coughing. Therefore, it’s important to remember that symptoms are not the only indication of what could be occurring inside your body. Even without symptoms present, chronic ILD with fibrosis may still be worsening and causing irreparable damage to your lungs. Additionally, progression doesn’t always show up on HRCT scans, which is why it’s important that other tests  are performed in order to monitor for progression."],
